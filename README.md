# Electron MPW

This is an Electron based desktop app for managing passwords following the principle of "master password" from Maarten Billemont, Lyndir (http://masterpasswordapp.com/).

This is an independent implementation from a different author following the published algorithm.

Features:
* Loads+saves configuration in XML, compatible with https://github.com/gomasch/DotNetMasterPassword.
* Import 2nd file with manual merge
* Simple search

Technology:
* Pure Javascript with Electron.  
* UI with React and Bootstrap.
* Uses emscripten-compiled SCRYPT implementation from https://github.com/tonyg/js-scrypt
* Main editor/IDE VSCode.

## Motivation
On iPhone I am using the original app from Maarten Billemont. For the desktop I didn't like the original Java app and decided 2015 to build simple desktop apps for Win+Mac with C#. The result can be found at https://github.com/gomasch/DotNetMasterPassword.

When trying to add some features (import, search) later in 2017, I grew uncomfortable with the C# solution and took that as an excuse to explore a completely new (and new-to-me) stack: build a cross plattform UI app with Electron, Javascript and HTML. It worked suprisingly well. I was especially pleased with npm, React and the speed of emscripten-based js-scrypt.

* Run "npm install" to get dependencies.

Build, Test, Run
* Run "npm run dist" to compile the sources and run "npm start" to start the development Electron instance. Consider to modify index.html and main.js during development. For example you can uncomment "mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();" in main.js.
